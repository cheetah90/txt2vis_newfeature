    "text": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 The first full year of the Affordable Care Act brought historic increases in coverage for low-wage workers and others who have long been left out of the health care system, a New York Times analysis has found. Immigrants of all backgrounds \u2014 including more than a million legal residents who are not citizens \u2014 had the sharpest rise in coverage rates.\nHispanics, a coveted group of voters this election year, accounted for nearly a third of the increase in adults with insurance. That was the single largest share of any racial or ethnic group, far greater than their 17 percent share of the population. Low-wage workers, who did not have enough clout in the labor market to demand insurance, saw sharp increases. Coverage rates jumped for cooks, dishwashers, waiters, as well as for hairdressers and cashiers. Minorities, who disproportionately worked in low-wage jobs, had large gains.\nThe health care law was one of the most bitterly contested pieces of legislation in the country\u2019s history. It remains controversial because of its costs to both taxpayers and insurance customers. The high premiums and high deductibles of many plans still make coverage a crushing financial burden for some families.\nAnd the law is not close to achieving the goal of universal coverage, in part because 19 states have declined to expand their Medicaid programs for the poor, an option the Supreme Court granted them in a landmark 2012 case. Nevertheless, the Times\u2019s analysis shows that by the end of that first full year, 2014, so many low-income people gained coverage that it halted the decades-long expansion of the gap between the haves and the have-nots in the American health insurance system, a striking change at a time when disparities between rich and poor are growing in many areas.\n\u201CThe law has clearly reduced broad measures of inequality,\u201D said David Cutler, an economics professor at Harvard, who served in the Clinton administration and advised the 2008 Obama campaign on health issues. \u201CThese are people who blend into the background of the economy. They are cleaning your hotel room, making your sandwich. The law has helped this population enormously.\u201D\nUntil now, the impact of the law has been measured mostly in broad numbers of newly insured people \u2014 about 20 million by the administration\u2019s most recent account. But the Times\u2019s analysis of census data from 2014, the first year the heart of the law was in full effect, provides a finely detailed look at who the newly insured actually are \u2014 by race, education, occupation, immigration status, and family structure.\nThe analysis shows how the law lifted some of the most vulnerable citizens. Part-time workers gained insurance at a higher rate than full-time workers, and people with high school degrees gained it at double the rate of college graduates. Adults living in households headed by relatives, such as siblings or cousins \u2014 often a marker of economic distress \u2014 gained insurance at double the rate of those in traditional households.",
