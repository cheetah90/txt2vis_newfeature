    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 For more than 100 years, women have waited for a portrait of someone of their sex at the center of a paper note, a wait that appeared to be ending when Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew announced 10 months ago that he would choose a woman for a new $10 bill in development.\nBut then the fame of a striving immigrant from the West Indies named Alexander Hamilton achieved unlikely heights in the lights on Broadway more than 200 years after his untimely death. The first Treasury secretary, in the 18th century, Hamilton became a 21st-century rap-musical phenomenon, and a small coterie of history-minded Hamiltonians swelled by millions to include not just well-heeled adults shelling out up to thousands of dollars a ticket but teenagers rapping Hamilton\u2019s life story at the dinner table.\nNow Mr. Lew is leaning toward keeping Hamilton at the center of the $10 note and placing a vignette of female historical figures on the flip side.\nBut, in keeping with his announcement last June, Mr. Lew is expected to simultaneously announce that a woman will be front and center on the more numerous $20 notes \u2014 displacing the (currently) less popular Andrew Jackson \u2014 and that one or more women will be on the $5 bill as well. Mr. Lew\u2019s own public hints in recent weeks have pointed in this direction.\n\u201CWe\u2019re not talking just about one bill,\u201D Mr. Lew said Thursday on CNBC. \u201CWe\u2019re talking about the $5, the $10 and the $20.\u201D And last month he carefully avoided saying a woman\u2019s portrait would be at the center of the $10 bill, telling Charlie Rose in an interview on PBS, \u201CWe are going to put a woman on the face of our currency.\u201D\nStill, it would be years before the $20 and $5 bills could be redone, a time lag that would infuriate many eager to see a woman honored.\n\u201CIf Jack Lew keeps Hamilton on the front, then I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever see a woman on the front,\u201D said Shelley Zalis, founder of the Girls Lounge, a networking organization for female corporate leaders. \u201CWho knows if that will ever be a reality?\u201D\nThe $20 and $5 bills are next in the government\u2019s process of redesigning currency to deter increasingly sophisticated counterfeiters, and also to add new tactile features for identification by the visually impaired. Given the complexity of the process, new versions would probably not enter circulation before the 2030s, government officials say.",
