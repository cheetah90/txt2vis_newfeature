A student hiked down the mountain to get cellphone reception and called for help. No one else was hurt.\nA helicopter flew Wagner off the mountain and took him to an Anchorage hospital, where he is in intensive care, a university statement said. The hospital said Wagner, 35, of Juneau, would not give interviews.\nWagner has been coordinating and teaching in the university's outdoor studies program since 2006, according to his biography. He teaches rock and ice climbing, backcountry navigation, glacier travel and mountaineering.\nHis teaching schedule says he planned to leave the mountain by Tuesday.\nThe Haines Police Department alerted Alaska State Troopers to the attack Monday. After flying Wagner to the hospital, authorities took the students down from the mountain, and they spent the night in the town of Haines with another professor.\nStudents on Tuesday planned to take a ferry back to Juneau, about 90 miles north, Bausler said.\nWagner is the second man attacked by a bear in Alaska within days. A 77-year-old bear hunter is recovering at an Anchorage hospital from injuries he suffered when a grizzly mauled him in interior Alaska on Friday.\n"}
