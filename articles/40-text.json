One email chain shows Pawa asking Lemuel Srolovic, chief of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman\u2019s Environmental Protection Bureau, if he can confirm his attendance to a Wall Street Journal reporter. Srolovic requests he not do so.\n\u201cMy ask is if you speak to the reporter, to not confirm you attended or otherwise discuss the event,\u201d Srolovic wrote .\nAnother email chain shows Srolovic and Scott Kline, a Vermont assistant attorney general, even drawing up a Common Interest Agreement, in order to protect as privileged the discussions at the meeting.\nThe meeting occurred the same day as a press conference featuring former Vice President Al Gore where 17 attorneys general announced a coalition to more aggressively target oil companies they claim have deceived the public over the risks of climate change.\nMassachusetts and the U.S. Virgin Islands, whose AG is an independent, announced probes into the oil giant the same day. California Attorney General Kamala Harris had announced a similar probe in January.  The probes follow a related investigation by Schneiderman\u2019s office, who subpoenaed Exxon\u2019s financial records and emails last November. \nThe latest emails are hardly the first sign of a coordinated push against Exxon. \nAccording to the Wall Street Journal , a January meeting in Manhattan was a key moment in the plan to unleash a Big Tobacco-style government probe of oil companies. The meeting brought together several veteran environmental activists to discuss how to \u201cestablish in [the] public\u2019s mind that Exxon is a corrupt institution that has pushed humanity (and all creation) toward climate chaos and grave harm.\u201d \nAs more emails are released, Exxon is striking back. \n\u201cThese revelations from the meeting in January, and now these emails, show that there is a lot of collaboration, collusion, conspiracy -- pick a word -- that shows these groups and trial lawyers working together to attack a company that has 75,000 employees and millions of shareholders,\u201d Alan Jeffers, media relations manager for ExxonMobil told FoxNews.com. \u201cThat\u2019s who these people are attacking, these employees and shareholders who benefit when the company does well.\u201d\n\"In the end, it seems the only parties that may be breaking the law are those colluding AGs in their scheme to silence political opposition, while seeking funds for their preferred policy agenda,\u201d Chris Horner, an attorney who obtained the email records for the E&E Legal Institute and whose own group was targeted with a subpoena, wrote in a FoxNews.com op-ed .\nA spokesman for the New York Attorney General\u2019s office denied any accusation of collusion.\n\u201cThe office routinely collaborates with other states and receives input from outside organizations. Ultimately, decisions on which cases we pursue are based solely on the merits and the law\u2014and nothing else,\" Matt Mittenthal told FoxNews.com in an email. \nSchneiderman has indicated ExxonMobil is not the only energy company in his office's crosshairs, vowing to prosecute any that committed fraud to maximize profit at the public's expense \u201cto the fullest extent of the law.\u201d\nExxonMobil last week issued a challenge to a subpoena issued by the Virgin Islands, calling it unwarranted and an attack on ExxonMobil\u2019s freedom of speech."}
