    "text": "US tech giant Intel is shedding 12,000 jobs as it seeks to cut reliance on the declining personal computer market.\nThe maker of computer chips will take a $1.2bn charge to cover restructuring costs.\nThe job cuts, about 11% of Intel's workforce, will be made over the next 12 months, Intel said in a statement .\nIntel said it wants to \"accelerate evolution from a PC company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices\".\nThe company also said on Tuesday chief financial officer Stacy Smith would move to a new role leading sales, manufacturing and operations.\nIntel said it would begin a formal search process for a successor.\nShares in the company were down 2.5% in after-hours trading on Wall Street. Intel's stock price had already fallen 8.4% this year.\n'Uncomfortable bed'\nThe world's largest computer chipmaker also lowered its revenue forecast for the year.\nThe California-based company has been focusing on its higher-margin data centre business as it looks to reduce its dependence on the slowing PC market.\nGlobal personal computer shipments fell 11.5% in the first quarter, research firm IDC said on Monday.\nIntel did not identify where the job cuts would fall. Most of the company's factories are in the US.\nThe cuts were \"not a surprise,\" said NPD analyst Stephen Baker. \"For everybody who has made their bed in old tech, trying to lie in it is pretty uncomfortable right now.\"\n",
