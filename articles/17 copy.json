    "text": "The gun industry has boomed over the past eight years resulting in a massive increase in gun-related jobs throughout the country.\nThe number of full-time jobs in the firearms industry increased from about 166,000 in 2008 to nearly 288,000, according to a new report from the National Shooting Sports Foundation, or NSSF. That represents a 73 percent increase.\nIn 2015 alone, the gun industry went from 263,223 jobs to 287,986, an increase of nearly 25,000 jobs.\nThe NSSF estimates that the gun industry currently has a total economic impact of nearly $50 billion. That\u2019s up 158 percent from $19.1 billion in 2008. Wages in the industry rose 126 percent over the same time period. The average industry worker now receives $50,180 between wages and benefits.\nThe gun industry has also generated record amounts of tax revenue for both the federal government and state governments in the past eight years. In 2015, the federal government collected $3.7 billion in tax revenue, an increase of 144 percent since 2008. State governments saw nearly double the tax revenue over the same period. Excise taxes are also up 92 percent.\n",
