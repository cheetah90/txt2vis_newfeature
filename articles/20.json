    "text": "The 7.8-magnitude quake struck Ecuador's Pacific coast on Saturday, and the search for survivors continues.\nThe cost of rebuilding is likely to be in the billions of dollars, President Rafael Correa said during a visit to the worst-affected region.\nHe said it was the biggest tragedy to hit Ecuador in the past seven decades. Some 2,500 people were injured.\nLate on Monday, six people, including two girls - one three years old and the other nine months old - were rescued from the ruins of a hotel near the coastal town of Manta.\nElsewhere, funerals for some of those killed were held in Portoviejo and Pedernales, two towns that were the worst hit.\n\"I fear that figure will go up because we keep on removing rubble,\" a shaken Mr Correa said in a televised address. \"There are signs of life in the rubble, and that is being prioritised.\"\nThe quake comes at a time when the oil-producing country is already reeling from the slump in global crude prices.\nLuis Almagro, the secretary general of the Organization of American States, said some of the group's rarely used emergency funds would be unlocked and given to Ecuador to help it rebuild.\nAn hour inland from Pedernales, we come across a digger working its way through a mound of rubble. This, we are told, was Joselo's house - or what's left of it. A three-storey building turned to rubble.\nAccording to the neighbours, most had got out as soon as the earthquake struck. Joselo was trying to get his car out of the garage when the roof collapsed on top of him. A bloodied pillow and his T-shirt lie tossed in a corner of what now looks like a building site.\nDozens of former residents climb on to the rubble and sift through broken stones to recover whatever belongings remain intact.\n\"I had to make an unexpected trip out of town,\" says Emilio Solorzano. \"Just as well, otherwise I would have been crushed, I'm standing on my bedroom.\"\nWestern Ecuador was hit by a number of strong aftershocks on Monday, the largest of which measured magnitude 5.1.\nIn Pedernales, close to the epicentre, as many as 400 people are feared dead. Mayor Gabriel Alcivar said the \"entire town\" had been flattened.\n\"Pedernales is devastated,\" he told local media. \"Buildings have fallen down, especially hotels where there are lots of tourists staying. There are lots of dead bodies.\n\"We're trying to do the most we can but there's almost nothing we can do,\" he added, warning that looting had broken out.",
