The gold, which weighs more than a ton , is worth $39.6 million.\nApple recovered more than 63 million pounds of various materials via its \u201ctake-back\u201d recycling initiatives in 2015, according to the company\u2019s environmental report. The tech giant gathered over 23 million pounds of steel, making it the most recycled material, and more than 13 million pounds of plastics. Other recycled materials include glass, aluminum, copper, cobalt, nickel, lead, zinc, tin and silver.\nGold and copper are present in iPhone camera technology, while cobalt and lithium are used in batteries. Silver is deployed in motherboards.\nEarlier this year Apple consolidated a number of customer recycling programs into its Renew initiative, which lets customers return old devices to the company. Depending on the device, some products are eligible for credit from Apple.\nThe Cupertino, Calif.-based firm is also harnessing sophisticated technology to boost its recycling efforts. \u201cExisting recycling techniques, like shredding, only recover a few kinds of materials and often diminish their quality,\u201d it explained, in its annual report. \u201cSo we invented Liam, a line of robots designed to disassemble 1.2 million phones a year, sorting all their high-quality components and reducing the need to mine more resources from the earth.\u201d\nThe Liam prototypes, which disassemble the iPhone 6, are now operating in California and Holland. \u201cWe hope this kind of thinking will inspire others in our industry,\u201d Apple added.\nSpeaking during Apple\u2019s iPhone SE launch event last month, Lisa Jackson, the company\u2019s vice president for Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, said the robots help save natural resources. \u201cTungsten from the iPhone alert module can be used to make a precision cutting tool and the silver from the motherboard can be used in a solar panel,\u201d she said. \u201cUltimately our goal is to create breakthroughs that allow us to use high-quality materials in our own products.\u201d\nEnvironmental group Greenpeace welcomed Apple\u2019s high-tech recycling move.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a model that we would like to see grow,\u201d Gary Cook, senior IT analyst at Greenpeace, told FoxNews.com. \u201cWhat they are trying to be is a catalyst in the [tech] sector \u2013 if you look at the sector at the moment, most of the e-waste ends up just going into shredders, so you\u2019re giving up on the components in the product.\u201d\nCook added that people working in the electronics recycling industry also need better guidance from tech manufacturers on how to recover valuable components. \u201cWe would like to see Apple and others provide information on how to disassemble these products,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t easily break down the product in a way that lets you harvest what is inside, it could end up in a shredder.\u201d"}
