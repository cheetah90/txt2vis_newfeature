Intel's stock price had already fallen 8.4% this year.\nThe world's largest computer chipmaker also lowered its revenue forecast for the year.\nThe California-based company has been focusing on its higher-margin data centre business as it looks to reduce its dependence on the slowing PC market.\nGlobal personal computer shipments fell 11.5% in the first quarter, research firm IDC said on Monday.\nIntel did not identify where the job cuts would fall. Most of the company's factories are in the US.\nThe cuts were \"not a surprise,\" said NPD analyst Stephen Baker. \"For everybody who has made their bed in old tech, trying to lie in it is pretty uncomfortable right now.\"\n"}
