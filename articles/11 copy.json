Big landslides cut off remote mountain villages.\nSome 1,000 buildings have reportedly been damaged and at least 90 destroyed.\nAbout 2,000 people were treated for injuries and nearly 200 remain in a serious condition.\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe announced the number of troops helping in the rescue effort had risen to 25,000, and the US military would provide air transportation.\nAcross the valley from where I am standing in the small town of Minami-Aso, a huge landslide hundreds of metres long has severed a highway and buried part of the area.\nRescuers using earth-movers are now clearing away tonnes of mud and rock from around the half-buried houses. It's thought at least eight people are buried in the slide, although it could be more.\nThere has been heavy rain overnight and aftershocks are continuing to strike all the time.\nIn the badly-hit town of Mashiki thousands of people spent a third night sleeping in evacuation centres, in their cars, or even in the open.\nPeople here are very badly shaken. This part of Japan is not prone to large quakes. Everyone I have spoken to has said the same - they have never experienced anything like this in their lives.\nJapanese rescue teams scoured the remains of homes and buildings, and some used shovels to dig through the mountains of soil to try to reach people still trapped beneath.\nMost of those missing were from the badly-hit village of Minami-Aso.\nThere have reportedly been more than 440 aftershocks in the area since Thursday.\nWith evacuation centres reportedly full to the brim, many people have been forced to stay out in the open.\n\"I sleep in a car and stay in this tent during the day,\" one 52-year-old resident of nearby Mashiki told the AFP news agency.\nA number of large firms have factories in the Kumamoto region. Electronics giant Sony Corp and motor manufacturer Honda said they were suspending their plants in the region.\nCar giant Toyota said its production plants across Japan would have to be suspended because the quakes had disrupted its supply of parts.\nBank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, attending a G20 event in Washington, said it was too soon to analyse the economic damage caused by the quake, but bank operations in Kumamoto were still functioning normally.",
