    "text": "The Supreme Court appears to be divided over US President Barack Obama's plan to spare deportation for millions living in the country illegally.\nChief Justice John Roberts suggested in questioning he may side with Obama if the programmes enact some changes.\nThe White House wants to protect about four million people from deportation and give them work status in the US.\nBut 26 US states have objected, saying it will impose extra burdens like the issuing of driver licences.\nPresident Obama announced the plan, known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA), in November 2014. The plan has been put on hold by lower courts.\nImage copyright EPA\nImage caption Supporters of the law argue it keeps families safe and holds them together\nThe four liberal justices appeared to back Mr Obama's policies while the four conservatives, including Mr Roberts, appeared opposed or unsure.\nThere is a strong possibility the court will vote in a 4-4 deadlock, and block the programmes.\nOn the campaign trail on Monday in New York, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said if she were to become president, she would \"go further\" than the Obama plan.\nShe said she will propose comprehensive immigration reform legislation within 100 days of being in office and create a path to citizenship for undocumented people.\nThe states opposed to the plan say it would increase costs for law enforcement, health care and education.\nRepublicans are unhappy that the president has - in their view - overstepped his powers by using executive orders that bypass Congress.\nBut Mr Obama says immigration reform has languished in Congress for too long.\n",
